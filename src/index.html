      Apollo 11 (July 16–24, 1969) was the American spaceflight that first
      landed humans on the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot
      Buzz Aldrin landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on

        >July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC</time
      >, and Armstrong became the first person to step onto the Moon's surface
      six hours and 39 minutes later, on July 21 at 02:56 UTC. Aldrin joined him
      19 minutes later, and they spent about two and a quarter hours together
      exploring the site they had named Tranquility Base upon landing.

      Apollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on
      Merritt Island, Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC, and it was the fifth
      crewed mission of

      Apollo program.

      Armstrong's first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on live TV to
      a worldwide audience. He described the event as
      <em>"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind."</em

      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p>
        In the late 1950s and early 1960s,
        <i>the United States was engaged in the Cold War</i>, a geopolitical
        rivalry with the Soviet Union. On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union
        launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite. This surprise
        success fired fears and imaginations around the world. It demonstrated
        that <i>the Soviet Union</i> had the capability to deliver nuclear
        weapons over intercontinental distances, and challenged American claims
        of military, economic and technological superiority.
      </p>

      <p>
        On May 25, 1961, Kennedy addressed the United States Congress on "Urgent
        National Needs" and declared:
      </p>

      <div>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the
            goal, before this decade [1960s] is out, of landing a man on the
            Moon and returning him safely to the Earth. No single space project
            in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important
            for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so
            difficult or expensive to accomplish. We propose to accelerate the
            development of the appropriate <i>lunar space craft</i>. We propose
            to develop alternate liquid and solid fuel boosters, much larger
            than any now being developed, until certain which is superior. We
            propose additional funds for other engine development and for
            unmanned explorations—explorations which are particularly important
            for one purpose which this nation will never overlook: the survival
            of the man who first makes this daring flight. But in a very real
            sense, it will not be one man going to the Moon—if we make this
            judgment affirmatively, it will be an entire nation. For all of us
            must work to put him there.
          </p>
